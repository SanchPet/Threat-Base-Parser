# About the program

Thanks you for the interest in my project. 
This is a WPF porject made by me as a second homework from my C# courses in ITMO University. 
There is a data parser from the base of threats of Federal Office for Technical and Export Control of Russia. 

__IMPORTANT!__ The program is made in __Russian__ language.
## Features:

Firstly, user is able to __choose a path to folder where to store the database__. Then the database is downloaded from the website as a parsed Excel document.
Wheh the program is launched, it checks if the database was already installed on user's PC. After the first session, if user
didn't delete the data, it will start from main menu.
In main menu user can __refresh the database__, __see full list of threats__ or __see one threat in details__. 
If the database was refreshed, user will see a message box with information about new sections. 
There is also exit button. 

Write me your thoughts about the code and my app. I am beginner and any code-review is very useful.
